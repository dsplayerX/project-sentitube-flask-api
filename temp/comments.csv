Oh-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

You know you love me (yo), I know you care (uh-huh)
Just shout whenever (yo), and I'll be there (uh-huh)
You are my love (yo), you are my heart (uh-huh)
And we will never, ever, ever be apart (yo, uh-huh)

Are we an item? (Yo) girl, quit playin' (uh-huh)
""We're just friends"" (yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
Said, ""There's another"" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (yo, uh-huh)

""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Oh, for you, I would've done whatever (uh-huh)
And I just can't believe we ain't together (yo, uh-huh)
And I wanna play it cool (yo), but I'm losin' you (uh-huh)
I'll buy you anything (yo), I'll buy you any ring (uh-huh)

And I'm in pieces (yo), baby, fix me (uh-huh)
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream (yo, uh-huh)
I'm goin' down (oh), down, down, down (uh-huh)
And I just can't believe, my first love won't be around, and I'm like

""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine (Luda!)

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks (woo)

She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazin'
'Cause she was so amazin'
And now, my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'

""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, no""
Like, ""Baby, baby, baby, oh""
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

I'm gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now, I'm all gone (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Outro: Justin Bieber]

You want my love, You want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends,What are you sayin'
Say theres another one, Looks right in my eyes

My first love broke my heart for the first time,
And I was like
Baby, baby, baby ooooh,like

When i was 13 i had my first love
There was nobody that to compare to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me go in crazy
Oh i was starstruck.
She woke me up daily dont need no starbucks
She made my heart pound
Asking for a beat when i see her in the street
And in the school on the playground
But i really wanna see her on the weekends
She knows she got me dazy
Cause she was so amazing and now my heart is breaking
But i just keep on sayin

Baby, baby, baby nooo
My baby, baby, baby noo
My baby, baby, baby nooo
I thought you'd always be mine mine

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playin'
We're just friends, what are you sayin'
Said, ""there's another, "" and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Oh, for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool
But I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything
I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
And I'm like baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or one could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She know she got me dazin'
'Cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh

1010,I remember the days playing modern warfare 2 after school with the boys on Xbox 360. With the front door wide open on a hot summer day with the cool air nicely blowing trough the windows and front door with baby playing at full blast. The good old days. No stress no heartbreak no problems. Now the world is the enemy. I’m so pleased that Justin as finally started been much more faithful too our Heavenly Father. I really got sick of his BS and hated him at one point. But now he’s a true brother grown into a real man. And regenerated my upmost respect thank goodness he got himself onto the right path. We all need to hit rock bottom to build foundation Hallelujah Justin 👏🏻🙏🏻,2,1
